  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Between 2002 and 2011, I lived in Osaka Japan. I was a software developer, but one of my hobbies was fashion. I learned much about Japanese culture, including the business culture, its national features and about Japanese people.</p>
  <p>As you may know, Japan is a small country of 4 major islands but highly developed in technology and fashion. I knew that Japan was number one in fashion style in all of Asia. They produce good products with high quality because the customer is considered as a god. Any business providing service or manufacturing products is very concerned with customer satisfaction and quality.</p>
  <p>The capital of Japan is Tokyo, and the second biggest city is Osaka, which also has its own fashion style. There are many fashion shops in these 2 cities and women are the most chic and fashionable. Japanese women like to use fashion accessories and styles can change every month with new designs.</p>
  <p>While in Japan, I used to attend fashion events and shows. I felt that I myself could be a fashion designer, however I had already chosen a different career path, but I think it is never too late and I am now starting as a retailer first and I hope to make my own designs someday. I can not draw and I can not sew but what I found is drawing and sewing are not guaranteed to make a good designer. It is all about the sense, visuality, thought, belief and personal character.</p>
  <p>Here on www.bujin-retail.com I retail imported fashion accessories from Japan. Do you know about the Kanzashi which is a hair stick? Ancient and traditionl Japanese women used to use Kanzashi for their hair while wearing the kimono. But nowadays it has become a fashion accessory in Japan, a very simple hair stick for all occassions. I used to use pencils instead of Kanzashi when I was a student. I wish that time that I had a Japanese Kanzashi for my hair. I would be a star at my school.</p>
  <p>Anyhow I would like you to enjoy these Japanese fashion accessories for sale through my website. I think we should enjoy and have fun using hair accessories and fashion. Because we are women who can make the world bright and interesting!</p>
